### Agricultural Data Lab

These experiments are primarily rooted in datasets covering Denmark, since this is where I live and I know my way around the officially provided data sets published by the government and/or suppliers.

The first experiment is one I did a while back showing exact [location of wind turbines in Denmark](http://martinnormark.github.io/windpowerdk/).
